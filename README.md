## Fun Fact

I'm an avid movie lover and chess player. I enjoy analyzing intricate plots on the screen as much as I do strategizing my next move on the chessboard. Whether it's unraveling the mysteries of a thriller or plotting my way to victory in a chess match, I find joy in the art of storytelling and strategic thinking.
